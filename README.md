# Better Start

This mod combines the [Guaranteed Start](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1264802784) and [Item Room Start](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1379926225) mods, while also including some additional fixes to address minor issues.

At the beginning of each run, this mod will:

- Remove the Curse of the Blind, if applied.
- Teleport you to the Treasure Room (or the Silver Treasure Room in Greed Mode).
- Ensure the item found there is of at least quality 3.
